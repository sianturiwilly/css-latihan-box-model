     	  <p>The spine of the side consisted of Academy graduates Axel Tuanzebe, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford, showing their character and quality on the Champions League stage against high-profile and world-class opponents such as Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.</p>

     	  <p>These boys honed their craft at the Aon Training Complex and are an absolute credit to the club. The pride that radiates from such a performance is magnified by those within the building who have worked with the players from an early age, shaping the sort of individual that can go toe-to-toe with the very best.</p>

     	  <p>Axelâ€™s mental strength and composure in returning after 10 months on the sidelines in such a setting was awe inspiring, and it is little wonder he earned special praise from his manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, afterwards. The feeling should be reciprocated because it was a big call from the boss to start the 22-year-old and further illustration, if any was needed, that he has faith in those brought up the United way.</p>
